# hi-kogiasima
Scripts used for analyses of dwarf sperm whale sightings and associated data for 2021 manuscript on site fidelity, spatial use, and behavior (Baird, Mahaffy, &amp; Lerma, In Review).

## DistBTSightings.R
Script to calculate distances between all possible pairs of sightings.

## Kogiasima_Drone_DistBearing.R
Script to estimate distances and bearings between consecutive drone locations during flights over dwarf sperm whales. Script also includes code to generate KMLs of individual drone segments.

## Kogiasima_HI_Maps.R
Script to generate two maps: (1) all CRC-only Ks sightings overlaid on vessel effort tracklines off Hawaii Island, with tracklines colored by sea state (low: B0-2, high: >B2); (2) map of all HIKs020 sightings (including non-CRC) with bathymetric depth contour lines.

## Kogiasima_SuppMap_EffortSight.R
Script to generate supplemental figure of sightings/effort tracklines off Maui Nui, Oahu, and Kauai/Niihau (stacked). Similar to Hawaii Island, effort tracklines are colored by sea state.
